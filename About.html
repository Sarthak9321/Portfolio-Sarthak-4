        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> As a fourth-year student majoring in computer engineering, I have developed a solid foundation in various programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, SQL, and Python. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in numerous mini projects that have allowed me to apply and enhance my skills. These projects include developing a sign language recognition system, creating websites for workers, and building movie websites. Each of these experiences has contributed significantly to my programming and web development abilities, providing me with practical knowledge and problem-solving skills. <br>

            My long-term objective is to work as a developer, where I can continue to grow and contribute to innovative projects. The hands-on experience gained from these mini projects has not only strengthened my technical skills but also sparked a passion for continuous learning and improvement. By working on diverse and challenging projects, I have learned to approach problems creatively and efficiently, preparing me for a successful career in the tech industry. </p>
